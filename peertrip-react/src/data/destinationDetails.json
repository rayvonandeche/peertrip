      "fullDescription": "The Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of Africa's most magnificent game reserves. Bordering Tanzania, the Mara is the northern extension of the Serengeti and forms a wildlife corridor between the two countries. It's named after the statuesque, red-cloaked Maasai people who live in the park and graze their animals as they have done for centuries. The park is famous for the Great Migration, when thousands of wildebeest, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle travel to and from the Serengeti, from July through October.\n\nThe Mara has one of the highest lion densities in world, and is home to all the Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo, and rhino). Other wildlife includes cheetah, zebra, giraffe, hyena, crocodile, hippo, and various antelopes. Over 450 bird species have been identified in the park.",
